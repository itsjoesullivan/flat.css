<h1>Typography</h1>

<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Headings are in Futura, conveying a sense of modernity and permanence.</p>
<div class="example right">
<h1>h1 Heading 1</h1>
<h2>h2 Heading 2</h2>
</div>
<h2>Copy</h2>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
	<p>Spacing between lines is exaggerated. Visitors are encouraged to read between them.</p>
	<div class="example right">
		<p>When Arthur Manchek stepped into the small soundproofed booth and sat down before the telephone, he knew exactly what he was going to do--but he was not very sure why he was doing it.</p>
	</div>

<h3>Italics</h3>
<p>Italic type is slanted to the right, creating the illusion of cursive.</p>
<div class='example right'>
<i>"Beauty is truth, truth beauty," - that is all 
        Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.</i>
</div>
